This is the README for my website.  You may contact me at my GitHub account http://www.github.com/nonabelian

This project serves as my website and a testing ground for learning to 'program' in HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery. I look forward to adding some cool functionality and content.  Questions and comments are welcome.
