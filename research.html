  <b>ARSNN (Adaptive Random Slow Neural Network)</b> -- A neural network that
  learns (partly) by changing structure.  This is essentially a toy program
  to satisfy my curiosity.  Try playing around with it!
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>FEniCS BEC</b> -- This is a Python FEniCS script that solves,
  self-consistently, the Gross-Pitaevski equation in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions,
  to obtain the Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) ground state, using finite
  elements. Finite elements are particularly well suited to solving real-time
  nonlinear PDEs in arbitrary geometries.

  <b>Domain Wall Code</b> -- A code in Mathematica that finds the domain
  wall solution for a scalar field theory with four different vaccua. It would
  be interesting to extend this code to other potentials, to see all of the
  <q>spokes on the wheel</q>.
  </p>

  <b>Quantum Computation and Information</b> -- I have solved many problems
  from the book <q><i>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</i></q> by
  Nielsen and Chuang.  Here is a (growing) list of problems I can help with:
